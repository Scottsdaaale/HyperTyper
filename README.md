Hey there! Thanks for checking out my project! I worked on this project collabritively at my time at flatiron bootcamp. HyperTyper is a simple speed typing app. Start typing and a timer will begin (timer made using react-timer). The letters will turn green if they are correct, red if they are incorrect. After completion you are automatically brought to the results page where you can see your score! Hope you enjoy!
## How to get started
